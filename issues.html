                <h2>The Dog Meat Trade: A Cruel and Dangerous Trade</h2>
                <p>Every year, millions of dogs are brutally transported throughout Indonesia to supply the demand for dog meat. Our nationwide investigations have revealed the crude and brutal methods of capture, transport and slaughter, and the immense suffering caused to millions of dogs each year is unimaginable.  Many are stolen family pets and illegally trafficked dogs collected from the streets and rural communities. They are crammed into cages and sacks so tightly that they can’t move, their mouths bound shut so they can hardly breathe. They are taken on long journeys on bikes or in overcrowded trucks to supply markets, slaughterhouses and restaurants. Many die from suffocation, dehydration or heatstroke before they reach their final destination. For those who survive, they watch others being brutally killed in filthy slaughterhouses whilst they wait their turn.</p>

                    <h2>The Dog Meat Trade and Rabies Transmission</h2>
                    <p>Our nationwide investigations have revealed the immense suffering caused to millions of dogs each year. We have found crude and brutal methods of capture, transport and slaughter, and are also deeply concerned by the health risks to humans and animals associated with the dog meat trade including the transmission of rabies.

                    The dog meat trade involves large-scale, illegal movement of dogs of unknown disease and vaccination status between regencies (and islands), and disrupts herd immunity to rabies achieved through mass vaccination programs. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) has explicitly highlighted the trade in dogs for human consumption as a contributing factor to the spread of rabies in Indonesia – a deadly disease that has a devastating impact on human and animal health. So, whilst only a minority of Indonesians consumes dog meat – in fact it is estimated that just 7% of the population nationwide ever consumes dog meat – the trade threatens the health and safety of the whole country.
                        
                    The brutal and unhygienic slaughter and butchery of dogs and consumption of meat from rabies-positive animals puts humans at risk. Human deaths from rabies have been reported that have been directly linked to involvement in the slaughtering, butchery, handling and even consumption of meat from infected dogs.</p>
